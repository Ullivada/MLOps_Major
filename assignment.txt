ML Ops Major Assignment End-to-End MLOps Pipeline
ML Ops
Major Assignment
1 Overview & Learning Objectives
Goal
This assignment will guide you through building a complete, automated MLOps pipeline.
You will develop a PyTorch model, containerize it with Docker, build a CI/CD workflow
with GitHub Actions to automate training and deployment tasks, and finally, optimize
your model using quantization.
2 Dataset & Model
•Dataset:You will use theOlivetti faces datasetfromsklearn.datasets.
•Model:
1. You will train aDecisionTreeClassifiermodel usingscikit-learn.
3 Submission & Grading
3.1 Submission Requirements
→You must submit asingle PDF filenamedYourRollNo_Major.pdf.
→The first page must contain thepublic link to your GitHub repositoryand thepublic
link to your Docker Hub repository.
→The repository must contain all source code, theDockerfile, the GitHub Actions workflow
(ci.yml), other required files and aREADME.md.
→All branches (main,dev,docker_cicd) must be present in the final repository.
→Comprehensive documentation is required, including step-by-step screenshots covering both
command-line interactions and GitHub workflows. A detailed analysis should also be in-
cluded.
3.2 Grading Distribution (Total: 50 Marks)
Code + Git:10 Marks
Documentation:10 Marks
Viva:30 Marks
4 Step-by-Step Workflow & Task Breakdown
You must follow this precise Git branching strategy.
4.1 Step 1:mainBranch - Initial Setup
1. Initialize your GitHub repository with aREADME.mdand a.gitignorefile.

4.2 Step 2:devBranch - Model Development
1. Create and switch to a new branch nameddev.
2. Create atrain.pyscript that loads the sklearn Olivetti faces dataset and uses the
train_test_splitfunction to split the data into 70% trainset and 30% testset. Next,
trainascikit-learnDecisionTreeClassifiermodelonthetrainsetandsavethemodel
usingjoblibassavedmodel.pth.
3.Create atest.pyscriptthat loads thesavedmodel.pthmodel, computes its accu-
racy on the test set and display the test accuracy.
4.Configure the CI/CD workflowin.github/workflows/ci.ymlto run onpush.
The workflow must perform the following:
Job:check_working_repo
(a) Check out your repository’s code.
(b) Set up a Python environment and install dependencies.
(c) Run thetrain.pyscript to generate thesavedmodel.pthmodel file.
(d) Run thetest.pyscript to display the test accuracy of the saved model file.
5.Do not mergethis branch intomain.
4.3 Step 3:docker_ciBranch - Automation with Docker & CI/CD
1. Create and switch to a new branch nameddocker_cicdfromdev.
2.Develop a Flask web applicationthat will serve a web page to upload images and
display the predicted class. It will use the trained model saved earlier.
3.Create aDockerfilein the root directory.
4.Build the Docker imageusing theDockerfilethat runs the Flask web application
using the saved trained model.
5.Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
6.Deploy these containers using Kuberneteswhile ensuring3 replicasare always
running.
7.Do not Mergedocker_cicdbranch back intomain.
